        <h2>Hello, my name is Andrew Haralampoudis and I am high school student attending Madison High school as a junior in the fall.
            Some words I would use to describe myself are Student, Athlete, and Filmaker. 
            Some places you will often find me in my town are the library, the hockey rink or the sidelines filming my schools games.
            Although I love hockey and it has always been my favorite sport, I love staying active and trying new things out of season so I play some other sports.
            I also love traveling, check out my photos page to see more of this.
